  <h1>Privacy Policy for PasswordManager</h1>
  <p>PasswordManager securely stores users’ website usernames, passwords, comments, and record date/time locally in the user’s Chrome browser storage (Chrome Storage API). No data is collected, transmitted, or accessible by the extension developer or any third party. All information remains on the user’s device and can only be decrypted with the user’s master password.</p>
  <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
  <p>The extension does not collect any data outside the user's device. The only data stored is the information users explicitly save (usernames, passwords, comments, date/time) which is encrypted.</p>
  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To store encrypted account and password data locally.</li>
    <li><strong>ActiveTab:</strong> To detect the current tab URL and show the "Save To Password Manager" prompt.</li>
    <li><strong>Scripting:</strong> To inject content scripts to detect login fields on web pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Host permissions (&lt;all_urls&gt;):</strong> To access login forms on any website to offer password saving.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>No third-party services are used. All code runs locally within the extension package.</p>
  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>All stored data is encrypted using the user's master password. No password or sensitive data leaves the user’s device.</p>
  <h2>Contact</h2>
